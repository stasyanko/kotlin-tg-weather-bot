## Development:

It's better to run it as is without docker by downloading JDK with Intellij Idea.

Go to File -> Project Structure -> Platform Settings -> SDKs. 

Press the plus icon and select download JDK. 

Please use JDK 11. 

## Running with docker:

```sudo docker build -t tg-weather-bot .```

```sudo docker run tg-weather-bot```
